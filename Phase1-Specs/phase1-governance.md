# Phase 1 Governance Notes

## Decisions
- Chose three core capabilities: Task Manager, Workflow Automation, Reporting Agent.
- Each capability is modular and documented in its own spec file.
- Specs are written in Markdown for transparency and reproducibility.

## Constraints
- Only free/open-source tools will be used (Docker CE, Kind/Minikube, Helm, Obsidian, rovodev CLI).
- Deployment must be reproducible with one or two commands.
- Documentation must remain clear and judge-friendly.

## Rationale
- Task Manager ensures autonomy in organizing work.
- Workflow Automation demonstrates independent execution.
- Reporting Agent shows transparency and accountability.
- Together, these three capabilities represent an Autonomous AI Employee.
